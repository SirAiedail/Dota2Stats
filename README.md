# Dota2Stats

**Grab this skin [here](https://github.com/SirAiedail/Dota2Stats/releases).**

## Thanks to bo1g
He originally created this skin. He didn't update in over two years, so I took over and will now maintain a fixed and more up to date version here until he comes back.

## About the skin
This is a skin for Rainmeter that displays your Dota 2 statistics.
It uses data obtained from https://www.dotabuff.com/.

## Installation
Download and run the [latest installer](https://github.com/SirAiedail/Dota2Stats/releases/download/v1.1.1/Dota.2.Stats_1.1.1.rmskin).

If Rainmeter doesn't recognize the file, you will need to install it manually. Change the file's ending to `.zip` (you might have to enable file endings in Windows Explorer first) and unpack the files to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\`. Then activate the skin in Rainmeter.

Afterwards open `Variables.ini` located inside the `@Resource` folder in your favorite text editor such as Notepad and replace the text behind `URL=` with your Dotabuff profile URL.

## Customization
To customize the skin, open `Variables.ini` found in the `@Resources` folder in your favorite text editor such as Notepad and follow the instructions there.

## Future features
* Addtional modules:
  * Last three matches
  * Three most played heroes
* Customization module:
  * Resize option

**I'm open for requests.**
