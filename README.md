#Dota2Stats

##Thanks to bo1g
He originally created this skin. He didn't update in over two years, so I took over and will now maintain a fixed and more up to date version here until he comes back.

##About the skin
This a skin for Rainmeter that displays your Dota 2 statistics.
This skin uses the data obtained through Dota2Stats at https://dotabuff.com/.

##Installation
Unzip the contents of the zip file into your C:/Users/<YourUserName>/Documents/Rainmeter/Skins directory and activate the skin in Rainmeter.
Then open the Dota2Stats.ini in a text editor such as Notepad and paste the URL to your Dotabuff profile inside the quotes behind "URL=".

You also might need to install the font located in the fonts folder inside the skin folder.

##Customization
To customize the skin, open the Dota2Stats.ini in a text editor such as Notepad and follow the instructions in the "Setup" section.

##Bugs
* None, at the moment

##Future features
* None, I'm open for requests
